	Indian Airlines Flight Price Analysis

Description

	Conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a comprehensive dataset of flight booking records to understand the key factors influencing airfare
	prices in the Indian aviation market. The project involves cleaning raw data, performing statistical analysis, and visualizing trends to answer critical
	business questions regarding pricing strategies, route popularity, and booking behaviors. The analysis provides actionable insights for travelers and 
	airline pricing analysts.

Technologies Used:

	Python: Primary programming language for analysis.
	Pandas: Used for data cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation (grouping by airlines, cities, etc.).
	NumPy: utilized for numerical calculations and statistical summaries.
	Matplotlib & Seaborn: Employed to create advanced visualizations, including categorical plots, box plots, and relational line charts to depict price trends.

Achievements and Impact

	Dynamic Pricing Analysis: Identified a strong negative correlation between "Days Left" and "Ticket Price," confirming that last-minute bookings result in significantly higher fares.
	Airline Comparison: Benchmarked average ticket prices across major airlines (e.g., Vistara, Air India), revealing distinct pricing tiers between Economy and Business classes.
	Route Optimization: Mapped price variations across major cities (Source vs. Destination), visualizing how specific routes (e.g., Delhi to Hyderabad) impact cost.
	Time-of-Day Insights: Analyzed the impact of Departure and Arrival times on pricing, determining whether "Red-eye" or prime-time flights command higher premiums.
	Strategic Querying: Developed a logical framework to answer specific user queries, such as calculating the average cost for a specific airline on a specific route (e.g., "Vistara Business Class from Delhi to Hyderabad").
